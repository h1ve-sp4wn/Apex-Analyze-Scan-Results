Docker Method:

Build the Docker Image:

Open a terminal in the same directory where your Dockerfile and scanner_analysis.py are located.

Build the Docker image using the following command:

    docker build -t scanner-analysis .

This command will build the image and tag it as scanner-analysis.

Step 4: Run the Docker Container

Once the image is built, run the container using:

    docker run --rm scanner-analysis

This will execute the scanner_analysis.py script inside the Docker container. The --rm flag ensures that the container is removed after execution.

From inside the container, you can manually run the script or check for issues.

    docker run -it scanner-analysis /bin/bash

 Terminal method: 
 
 Install Python (if not installed already)

For Ubuntu (or Debian-based Linux):

    sudo apt update
    
    sudo apt install python3 python3-pip

For macOS (Python 3 is usually pre-installed):

To check if Python is installed, run:

    python3 --version

If it's not installed, you can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

For Windows:

Download and install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/. Ensure to select "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

Step 2: Install Required Python Libraries

Assuming the script requires libraries like requests, subprocess, and others, install them using pip:

Create a virtual environment (recommended but optional):

    python3 -m venv myenv
    
    source myenv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
    
    myenv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows

Install dependencies (you may need to specify a requirements file if available, but for this script, you can install directly):

    pip install logging subprocess json

If any other specific dependencies are required for your script (like a scanner library), you can add them similarly.

Step 3: Run the Python Script

Save the provided Python script to a file, e.g., scanner_analysis.py.

Now you can run the script via:

    python3 scanner_analysis.py

You can modify the scan_results dictionary with your specific data (scan results) for testing purposes. Once the script runs, it should log its output and provide the analysis in your terminal.
