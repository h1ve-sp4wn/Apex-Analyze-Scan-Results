# Apex-Analyze-Scan-Results
Script written in Python that loops through a set of scan results, analyzing each scan type (NMAP, web vulnerability scans, WAF, ZAP, etc.). Each scan returns suggestions or recommendations that are logged for the next best steps, such as patching vulnerabilities, adjusting configurations, or escalating the scanning intensity.
